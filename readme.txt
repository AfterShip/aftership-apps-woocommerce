== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Check the status of an order =
At AfterShip, you can track shipments at any time and from anywhere, with a tracking number.
Each tracking number is represented by status at every step of the shipment’s journey. Further, couriers provide checkpoint messages which are mapped to subtags. The real-time status of shipments at any time is given by the below statuses.

= Destination Country Tracking =
AfterShip automatically gets tracking information for both origin and destination country for international shipments of postal service (e.g. China Post, USPS). All the tracking checkpoints from both the couriers or locations are clubbed together under a single tracking number for a better understanding.

= Updating pending statuses =  
All recently added or imported shipments within your AfterShip account are tagged with "Pending" status, and queued up for tracking in batches. AfterShip automatically gets the latest tracking information from couriers every 3-12 hours.
If "Pending" status still shows for long, it usually means that the courier does not have any delivery information for the tracking number yet. Also, please check if the tracking number is correct, and contact the courier if need be. AfterShip will continue tracking until the courier updates on it’s server.
The “Pending” status changes to “Expired” if the courier does not provide any tracking information updates for over 30 days.  AfterShip will stop tracking the shipment.

= Add Track Button to WooCommerce store = 
WooCommerce is an open-source eCommerce plugin for WordPress. It can easily add eCommerce functionality to the WordPress website. With just a few clicks the plugin can be installed on the WordPress dashboard and set up to get the store up and running.

= Email notifications via AfterShip =
AfterShip allows its users to send email notifications for different delivery statuses. With swift email notifications, you can keep your customers updated about their order status.
You also get access to both HTML and drag-and-drop editors to customize your email notifications. It helps you leave a long-lasting impression on customers and builds brand equity.

= Customize the branded tracking page =
Tailor a dynamic branded tracking page. Upload promotional banner, logo, and favicon to make the tracking page more engaging. Also, connect your Facebook and Twitter profiles to build your brand and generate traffic.
